# Lifes Pattern Designer Future Plans

This document outlines the strategic development plans for the "Lifes" Pattern Designer, detailing both the initial launch and future enhancements.

## Initial Platform
- The application will initially be released as a web-based tool. This approach will allow for easy access from any device with an internet connection, facilitating collaboration among users and enabling rapid feedback and iteration during the early development stages.

## Future Development
- **C# Desktop Application:**  
  Following the web launch, a C# desktop version of the application will be developed. This version will incorporate a dedicated launcher and an auto-update feature, ensuring that users can always access the latest improvements and features without manual intervention. The desktop application will also aim to enhance performance and user experience, allowing for more complex simulations and larger pattern designs.

- **Feature Expansion:**  
  Future iterations of the application may include a broader array of scripting methods and enhanced user interface options. Potential features under consideration include:
  - Improved performance optimizations for handling larger patterns.
  - Advanced visualization tools to assist users in understanding the behavior of their designs.
  - Community-driven features, such as pattern sharing, collaboration tools, and user-generated content.
