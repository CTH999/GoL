# Design Documentation Documentation
**Important Notice: This document is intended for reference only and should not be altered in any way. Any modifications to this document are prohibited.**

- All design documents are `.md` files.
- Small amounts of YAML code snippets may be inserted within the `.md` file.
- All design documentation is stored in `/docs/design-docs`.
- No files besides design documentation are to be put into `/docs/design-docs`.
- Any non-markdown file inside of `/docs/design-docs` must be moved elsewhere, as it isn't a design document.
	-unless it's is, but not in markdown. in that case, fix it.
- any design documentation in the wrong place must be moved into `/docs/design-docs`
	
- The first section of any design documentation explains its purpose.
- Any design documentation must be a single file, meaning no creation of `.yaml` and `.md` files for the same thing.
- filine names must follow formating bellow:
	`[ProjectName]_[DocumentType]_[Version]_[Date].[FileExtension]`

- There are some pre-set, guaranteed design documents. They are:
  1. [Contents](#contents)
  2. [Design Document Formatting Guidelines](#design-document-formatting-guidelines)
  3. [Future Plans](#future-plans)

- **[Major Guidelines](#major-guidelines) must be highly emphasized, and utilized whenever any docs change to make sure they are right.**
  - **This means it's even more prioritized than normal, based on what is described inside Major Guidelines.**

## **Major Guidelines**

- **Anyone making design documentation must follow these guidelines, be they human, AI, or something else.**
- **Bolded text is emphasized, meaning it is even more followed.**
- **A bold header means all instructions within it are treated as if they are bold.**
  - **Bolded text within bold text is even more important than bold text.**
- **Design docs must have proper formatting, meaning they are clear, concise, self-explanatory, and in the proper syntax.**
- Using bolding for emphasis must be used sparingly.

# **Pre-Set Documents **
this contains info on the pre-set documents, both general info, and the specific info
 - if a pre-set document doesn't exist, make it based on the information provided in the descripions later in this section
	- pre-set documents are immune to the nameing conventions, and still kept in the documentations area
## [Contents](/docs/design-docs/contents.md)
- contains links to all design Documentation
	-useing a link realitive to /docs/design-docs
- **must be updated whenever a file changes, be it removeal, deletion, or change in useage**
- below the link is a quick description (1 to 2 sentences) on the useage of the file it's linked to

## [Design Document Formatting Guidelines](/docs/design-docs/Design_Document_Formatting_Guidelines.md)
- contains information on how to format design Documentation
- contains basic refference information
- is the file currently being read

## [Future Plans](/docs/design-docs/Future_Plans.md)
- This document contains larger ideas and concepts that will be developed and added in the future.
	- so, that means that an idea for a new feature, or a major code change. A thought on what color to use in the UI, that's a different story
	
# **Automated Prompt**
This section outlines the prompt that will be automatically used when haveing AI assist or generate documentation or related content.

**Prompt:**  
Generate efficient design documentation files based on discussed features. Ensure maximum detail while avoiding the creation of extraneous files. Remove any unnecessary files and edit the contents as needed. Assist in improving the phrasing and wording of ideas, integrating them seamlessly. Utilize the requirements specified in this document, including file formatting and organizational guidelines. Furthermore, provide the ability to create multiple design documents at once, breaking down features into a structured format similar to what is outlined above. Ensure that background formatting is maintained and consistent throughout the documentation. All created documents should be displayed in Markdown format, similar to how this document is currently presented. Additionally, always display the contents of this file to ensure access, preventing any issues in case the file is removed.*
