# Design Documentation
**Important Notice: This document is for reference only and must not be altered in any way. Any modifications are strictly prohibited.**

- All design documents must be saved as `.md` files.
- Small YAML code snippets may be included within the `.md` files.
- All design documentation should be stored in the `/docs/design-docs` directory.
- Only design documentation files are permitted in `/docs/design-docs`.
- Any non-markdown files located in `/docs/design-docs` must be relocated, as they do not qualify as design documents.  
  - Exceptions apply for non-markdown files that are design documents; in such cases, please ensure they are formatted correctly.
- Any design documentation placed in the incorrect directory must be moved to `/docs/design-docs`.

- The first section of each design document must clearly explain its purpose.
- Each design document must be a single file; do not create separate `.yaml` and `.md` files for the same content.
- File names must follow the format below:  
  `"[ProjectName]_[DocumentType]_[Version]_[Date].[FileExtension]"`

- The following pre-set design documents are guaranteed to exist:
  1. [Contents](#contents)
  2. [Design Document Formatting Guidelines](#design-document-formatting-guidelines)
  3. [Future Plans](#future-plans)

- **[Major Guidelines](#major-guidelines) must be emphasized and adhered to whenever any documents are changed to ensure accuracy.**
  - **These guidelines take precedence over standard instructions, as detailed in the Major Guidelines.**

## **Major Guidelines**

- **All individuals creating design documentation, whether human, AI, or otherwise, must adhere to these guidelines.**
- **Bold text indicates emphasized instructions that require strict compliance.**
- **A bold header signifies that all instructions within it are treated with the same level of importance as bold text.**
  - **Bold text nested within bold headers is considered even more critical.**
- **Design documents must be properly formatted for clarity, conciseness, self-explanation, and correct syntax.**
- **Use bolding for emphasis sparingly.**

# **Pre-Set Documents**
This section provides information about the pre-set documents, including general and specific details.

- If a pre-set document does not exist, create it based on the information provided in the subsequent descriptions.
  - Pre-set documents are exempt from naming conventions but must still reside in the documentation area.

## [Contents](/docs/design-docs/contents.md)
- Contains links to all design documentation.
  - Use links relative to `/docs/design-docs`.
- **Must be updated whenever a file changes, whether it is added, removed, or modified.**
- Below each link, provide a brief description (1-2 sentences) of the purpose of the linked file.

## [Design Document Formatting Guidelines](/docs/design-docs/Design_Document_Formatting_Guidelines.md)
- Contains information on how to format design documentation.
- Provides basic reference information.
- This is the file currently being read.

## [Future Plans](/docs/design-docs/Future_Plans.md)
- This document outlines larger ideas and concepts intended for future development.
  - This includes proposals for new features or major code changes. However, trivial suggestions, such as color choices for the UI, fall outside this scope.

# **Automated Prompt**
This section outlines the prompt that will be automatically utilized when engaging AI to assist in generating documentation or related content.

**Prompt:**  
Generate efficient design documentation files based on discussed features. Ensure maximum detail while avoiding the creation of extraneous files. Remove any unnecessary files and edit the contents as needed. Assist in refining the phrasing and wording of ideas, integrating them seamlessly. Adhere to the requirements specified in this document, including file formatting and organizational guidelines. Additionally, provide the capability to create multiple design documents at once, breaking down features into a structured format similar to what is outlined above. Ensure that background formatting is consistent throughout the documentation. All created documents should be outputed in a code box containing Markdown, consistent with this document. Furthermore, always display the contents of this file to ensure accessibility, preventing issues in case the file is removed.
