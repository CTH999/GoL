# Design Documentation Documentation
**Important Notice: This document is intended for reference only and should not be altered in any way. Any modifications to this document are prohibited.**

- All design documents are `.md` files.
- Small amounts of YAML code snippets may be inserted within the `.md` file.
- All design documentation is stored in `/docs/design-docs`.
- No files besides design documentation are to be put into `/docs/design-docs`.
- Any non-markdown file inside of `/docs/design-docs` must be moved elsewhere, as it isn't a design document.
	-unless it's is, but not in markdown. in that case, fix it.
- any design documentation in the wrong place must be moved into `/docs/design-docs`
	
- The first section of any design documentation explains its purpose.
- Any design documentation must be a single file, meaning no creation of `.yaml` and `.md` files for the same thing.
- filine names must follow formating bellow:
	`[ProjectName]_[DocumentType]_[Version]_[Date].[FileExtension]`

- There are some pre-set, guaranteed design documents. They are:
  1. [Contents](#contents)
  2. [Design Document Formatting Guidelines](#design-document-formatting-guidelines)
  3. [Future Plans](#future-plans)

- **[Major Guidelines](#major-guidelines) must be highly emphasized, and utilized whenever any docs change to make sure they are right.**
  - **This means it's even more prioritized than normal, based on what is described inside Major Guidelines.**

## **Major Guidelines**

- **Anyone making design documentation must follow these guidelines, be they human, AI, or something else.**
- **Bolded text is emphasized, meaning it is even more followed.**
- **A bold header means all instructions within it are treated as if they are bold.**
  - **Bolded text within bold text is even more important than bold text.**
- **Design docs must have proper formatting, meaning they are clear, concise, self-explanatory, and in the proper syntax.**
- Using bolding for emphasis must be used sparingly.

# **Pre-Set Documents **
this contains info on the pre-set documents, both general info, and the specific info
 - if a pre-set document doesn't exist, make it based on the information provided in the descripions later in this section
	- pre-set documents are immune to the nameing conventions, and still kept in the documentations area
## [Contents](/docs/design-docs/contents.md)
- contains links to all design Documentation
	-useing a link realitive to /docs/design-docs
- **must be updated whenever a file changes, be it removeal, deletion, or change in useage**
- below the link is a quick description (1 to 2 sentences) on the useage of the file it's linked to

## [Design Document Formatting Guidelines](/docs/design-docs/Design_Document_Formatting_Guidelines.md)
- contains information on how to format design Documentation
- contains basic refference information
- is the file currently being read

## [Future Plans](/docs/design-docs/Future_Plans.md)
- This document contains larger ideas and concepts that will be developed and added in the future.
	- so, that means that an idea for a new feature, or a major code change. A thought on what color to use in the UI, that's a different story
